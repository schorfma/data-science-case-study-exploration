  introduction: |
    * This interactive case study will guide you through most parts involved when doing _Data Science_
        - We will not show the steps of preparing and validating the data and omit steps subsequent to the evaluation of the Machine Learning model

    #### How can we use a dataset to classify defendants' recidivism and what are the implications of such a system?

    * Primarily this presentations deals with the real data and models for predicting the recidivism of defendants arrested for crimes in a County in the United States
        - Recidivism is defined here as getting arrested again within the following two years after the arrest
        - Among training a classifier for this task, we will also look into the real model _COMPAS_ and its ethical implications
    * After this interactive experience you should have a basic understanding of the processes involved and their implications
        - Also you will see, that not much programming is required to get started
        - Feel free to visit this interactive web application following its presentation and start experimenting
