  terminology: Terminology

  term_statistics: |
    #### Statistics

    Explaining data from a theoretical and mathematical perspective

  term_data_science: |
    #### Data Science

    Application of computational or statistical methods to gain insight in some real world problem

  term_machine_learning: |
    #### Machine Learning

    Programming computers so they can learn from data

  compas_introduction: |
    * Commercial product of _Northpointe Inc._
    * Algorithm used in the US justice system

    #### What the Algorithm does

    * Trained on historical defendant data (Answers to 137 questions)
    * Prediction of likelihood (from `1` to `10`) that a defendant will be arrested again (Recidivism)

    #### The Problem

    > How fair can this system be and what could possibly or actually go wrong?

  term_compas: |
    #### _COMPAS_

    Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions

  term_recidivism: |
    #### Recidivism

    Criminally offend again within the next two years

  introduction: |
    * First we have a look at the term _Data Science_.

  further_introduction: |
    * This interactive case study will guide you through most parts involved when doing _Data Science_

    #### How can we use a dataset to classify defendants' recidivism and what are the implications of such a system?

    * Primarily this presentations deals with the real data and models for predicting the recidivism of defendants arrested for crimes in a County in the United States
        - Recidivism is defined here as getting arrested again within the following two years after the arrest
        - Among training a classifier for this task, we will also look into the real model _COMPAS_ and its ethical implications
    * After this interactive experience you should have a basic understanding of the processes involved and their implications
        - Also you will see, that not much programming is required to get started
        - Feel free to visit this interactive web application following its presentation and start experimenting
