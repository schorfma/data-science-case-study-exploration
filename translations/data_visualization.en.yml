  intro: |
    * Decision making increasingly relies on data
    * Data comes at us with such volume
    * Need of some layer of abstraction, such as visual one

  correlation_matrix_label: Correlation Matrix
  correlation_according_to_genders: Correlation according to genders

  data_correlation_intro: |
    * When we speak of correlation, we usually speak of the _Pearson_ correlation
    * Correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between two data series

  correlation_observations: |
    * The age (`age`) exhibits a weak negative correlation with the recidivism (`is_recid`) and juvenile cases (`juv_...`)
        - The latter could theoretically also be due to non-digitalized youth files for older people
    * A weak positive correlation between age (`age`) and criminal record (`priors_count`)
        - Could be connected to the fact that older people already had more life time to commit crimes
    * The criminal record (`priors_count`) exhibits a weak positive correlation with recidivism (`is_recid`)

  gender_option_all: All
  gender_option_female: Female
  gender_option_male: Male

  select_age_category_step_label: Select Age Category Step
  years: "%{count} years"

  boxplot_observations: |
    * The recidivists show a higher `priors_count` mean value in each age group interval
    * This observation is true for men and women
    * Men over all have more prior convictions (`priors_count`)
    * The people with overall less prior convictions (`priors_count`) were less likely to become recidivists (`is_recid`) in the observation period
    * Nevertheless it is impossible to clearly distinguish between recidivists and non-recidivists for people with a low count of prior convictions (`priors_count`)
