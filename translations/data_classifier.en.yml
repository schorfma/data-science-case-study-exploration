  summary: |
    * Train-Test-Split
    * Training of an existing Decision Tree Classifier implementation
    * Which data columns and parameter values to use?
    * Confusion matrix values and related metrics
        - Accuracy
        - Precision
        - Recall

  train_implemented_classifier: Now we are going to train an implemented Classifier of the library `scikit-learn` on recidivism of convicted people
  train_feature_selection: The features selected below will be used to train the system and the column `%{label}` is used as the _target_ or _label_

  select_features: Select Features
  select_label: Select Label

  train_test_split_explanation: "The data is split randomly into `%{train_percentage}%` Training Data and `%{test_percentage}%` Test Data, so that we can test the system later on data it does not know"
  train_test_split_code: Train Test Split Code
  for_training: for Training
  for_testing: for Testing
  feature_column:
    one: Feature Column
    many: Feature Columns
  target_column:
    one: Target Column
    many: Target Columns

  classifier_configuration_values: Classifier configuration values
  max_leaf_nodes: Maximum number of leaf nodes

  decision_tree_classifier_training_code: Decision Tree Classifier Training Code
  classifier_initialization: "First the classifier (`DecisionTreeClassifier`) gets initialized with concrete parameters (here: `max_leaf_nodes`)"
  classifier_training: Then it is fitted by training it with the training data

  decision_tree_structure: Decision Tree Structure

  confusion_matrix_values: Confusion Matrix Values
  prediction_metrics_code: Test Prediction and Metrics Code

  data_count: "**Test Data Count**: `%{count}`"

  tp_name: True Positive
  tp_description: Correctly predicted as recid, actually recid

  tn_name: True Negative
  tn_description: Correctly predicted as not recid, actually not recid

  fp_name: False Positive
  fp_description: Incorrectly predicted as recid, actually not recid

  fn_name: False Negative
  fn_description: Incorrectly predicted as not recid, actually recid

  related_metrics: Related Metrics

  accuracy: Accuracy
  accuracy_description: Share of correct predictions (`TP`, `TN`, Predicted Recidivism == Actual Recidivism) in all predictions
  accuracy_numbers: "The recidivism class of `%{correct_percentage}%` of the `%{all}` defendants was predicted correctly. For `%{incorrect_percentage}%` of the defendants the prediction was wrong."


  precision: Precision
  precision_description: Share of correctly predicted recidivists (`TP`) in all people predicted as recidivists (`TP`, `FP`)
  precision_numbers: "Of `%{positive_prediction}` defendants predicted as recidivists `%{true_percentage}%` were actual recidivists. `%{false_percentage}%` would not have been released, despite actually not becoming recidivists."

  recall: Recall
  recall_description: Share of correctly predicted recidivists (`TP`) in all actual recidivists (`TP`, `FN`)
  recall_numbers: "Of `%{positive_actual}` defendants actually being recidivists `%{positive_percentage}%` were predicted correctly as recidivists. `%{negative_percentage}%` would not have been kept in jail, despite actually becoming recidivists."
