  header_classifier_training: Training a Recidivism Classifier

  train_implemented_classifier: Now we are going to train an implemented Classifier of the library `scikit-learn` on recidivism of convicted people
  train_feature_selection: The features selected below will be used to train the system and the column `%{label}` is used as the _target_ or _label_

  select_features: Select Features
  select_label: Select Label

  train_test_split_explanation: "The data is split randomly into `%{train_percentage}%` Training Data and `%{test_percentage}%` Test Data, so that we can test the system later on data it does not know"
  train_test_split_code: Train Test Split Code
  for_training: for Training
  for_testing: for Testing
  feature_column:
    one: Feature Column
    many: Feature Columns
  target_column:
    one: Target Column
    many: Target Columns

  classifier_configuration_values: Classifier configuration values
  max_leaf_nodes: Maximum number of leaf nodes

  decision_tree_classifier_training_code: Decision Tree Classifier Training Code
  classifier_initialization: "First the classifier (`DecisionTreeClassifier`) gets initialized with concrete parameters (here: `max_leaf_nodes`)"
  classifier_training: Then it is fitted by training it with the training data
